# BiliShelf Helper Privacy Policy (Template)

Last updated: 2026-02-18

## 1. What data is processed
BiliShelf Helper does not create cloud accounts and does not proactively upload personal data to a developer-owned server.

The extension only processes data in these cases:
- When you open a Bilibili video page, video metadata is read for capture
- When you click save, data is sent to your local backend (`127.0.0.1` / `localhost`)
- Theme preference is stored in browser local storage

## 2. How data is used
Data is used only for local video collection management:
- Save video metadata
- Assign videos to folders
- Manage tags and search

## 3. Data sharing
The extension does not sell, rent, or share personal data with third parties.  
Unless you explicitly configure your own remote forwarding logic, data stays in your local environment.

## 4. Permission usage
- `storage`: store theme preference
- `activeTab`: sync theme updates to the current tab
- `bilibili.com` / `api.bilibili.com`: read page/API metadata
- `127.0.0.1` / `localhost`: call your local backend service

## 5. Contact
For public release, replace this section with your project homepage and contact email.
